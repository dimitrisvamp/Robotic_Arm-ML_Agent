# Robotic_Arm-Machine_Learning_Agent

## University Diploma Thesis
My diploma thesis for Computer Science and Engineering department of the University of Ioannina (UOI).

## Description
Imitation learning of an intelligent agent for object approach by robotic arm.

The imitation learning algorithm implemented for training is Behavioral Cloning from Observation (BCO).

The simulation of training and test procedure take place at mujoco-py (https://openai.github.io/mujoco-py/build/html/index.html) wrapper-simulator.

Robomimic framework (https://robomimic.github.io/docs/datasets/robosuite.html) provides a proficient-human dataset for robosuite enviroment. The enviroment used for this project
is ***"Lift"*** using low dimensional observation. 

Neural Networks implemented by using Tensorflow framework (https://www.tensorflow.org/).
